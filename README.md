# Prayer-Learner
It will be a great Application to learn how to pray. Whether you're an adult desire to learn, or maybe you're looking for a way to teach your children namaz, a revert/convert to Islam or even just someone wishing to revise how you should be praying. It focuses on correcting the posture while praying. It also emphasizes of other Practices of Islam for instance you will get to know the alerts of Hadith. It will facilitate you to ask questions by sitting in your home, reducing your time to find a suitable Mosque or scholar as there multiple fiqah exists. The exact posture can be measured if you want to practice it first you can do it freely then you can make attempt to perform Namaz and get to know which of the acts were right and which were wrong. Moreover it help you to find the Qibla direction as most of the times we are at new place and donâ€™t know where the Qibla is directed
